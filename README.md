# House_Price_Prediction
The House_Price_Prediction project aims to predict the housing price.It uses the Linear Regression Model to analyze various features of houses and learns patterns to estimate their prices accurately.

Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable or target variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.In this case the dependent variable or the target variable is the housing price while the other features are independent variables.
